# This fork is now dead

This was a temporary fork of [fs2-rabbit](https://github.com/gvolpe/fs2-rabbit) that is now no longer needed 
([upstream issue for reference](https://github.com/gvolpe/fs2-rabbit/issues/78)).

Please update to the latest [fs2-rabbit](https://github.com/gvolpe/fs2-rabbit).  Note that will require your other
dependencies to be compatible with cats-effect 1.x.

If for whatever reason you need to apply something to this fork use the branch `maintenance`.
